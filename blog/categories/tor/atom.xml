    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One day a parchment arrives a temple after a gathering. A young mind notices that although they are highly related, one of their stories have not been referenced at all in a festival. He explains this and other incredible stories from the festival. Young minds of the temple are disappointed. One of them mutters “I warned him about our studies here”. The other one exclaims “maybe it’s because our tample and its teachings are not famous enough!”. After the discussion settles, the words of wisdom has been spoken by Master Scientist:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Let’s not worry about petty academic behavior and concentrate on solving important problems.  Good work cannot be ignored in the long run…”</p>
