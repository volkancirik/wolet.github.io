    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am a big fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_A._Muller">Richard Muller</a> because of his insightful answers on quora. He announced his book in one of the answers on quora, I even preordered it hoping it would be as good as his answers on quora. His main argument is not only space is created, time is also created. The now we experience is the latest created time in the universe. His argument could be more convincing if he used the space more wisely. The book could have been much shorter if he excluded his side stories about how his collagues won prizes. Another annoying section is Part IV where he rants about physicalism and how and why he thinks he has a soul and free will which does not serve anything good for his argument about now. To his credit, he explains very well the hard topics of physics (e.g. relativity, quantum entanglement etc) to layman like me.</p>
