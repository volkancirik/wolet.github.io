hi! the shorter version of hello.

in my last semester at cmu i am taking advance multi-modal machine learning. it is a mixture of seminar+lab course i.e you read a bunch of papers + get hands on experience with problems/models. one of the requirements is that you have to post a short summary of each week's reading to instructors. i plan to use this as an excuse to keep a blag. we'll see how it goes.

and here's a test for a math equation 
$$
x_t = x_{t-1} + y_t
$$
