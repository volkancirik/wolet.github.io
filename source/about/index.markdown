I am second year MLT student at the [LTI](http://lti.cs.cmu.edu) of [CMU](http://www.cmu.edu/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Ed Hovy](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/) and [Louis-Philippe Morency](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/) . I was a member of [Deniz Yuret](http://www.denizyuret.com/)'s AI-LAB. I am interested in AI. The personal wobsite is [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~vcirik/).
